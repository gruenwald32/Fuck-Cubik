## About
Fuck Cubik allows you to make custom 3D models for ResourcePacks very easily. But unlike Cubik, Fuck Cubik has no ads, no limits and doesn't cost you a cent!

Your 3D models can be as complex as you want. For example, this TNT block was made out of 63 elements.![complex tnt block](http://fuck-cubik.wurst-client.tk/images/Fuck-Cubik_tnt.jpg)
